# fertility-sumstats

A small working paper exploring the relationship between per-allele effects on EA and fertility. You'll need summary statistics from:

https://thessgac.com/papers/14

https://thessgac.com/papers/7

You'll need R, quarto, and the R renv library. Then start R in the project directory
and call `renv::restore()` to install 
other required libraries.

The current version of the working paper is the PDF file above.

This repository also hosts ["Correcting selection effects of noisy polygenic scores: an idiot's guide"](https://hughjonesd.github.io/fertility-sumstats/estimating-selection-effects-idiots-guide.html). The raw quarto file is available in the docs/ folder.
